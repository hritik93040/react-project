                  Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical,
                  material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the
                  phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
                  The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
                  science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is
                  often understood as a separate category from other natural
                  phenomena.

                  The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is
                  derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities,

                  Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often
                  refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the
                  general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases
                  to the processe s associated with inanimate objectsâ€”the way

                  Animal welfare is the well-being of non-human animals. Formal
                  standards of animal welfare vary between contexts, but are
                  debated mostly by animal welfare groups, legislators, and
                  academics. Animal welfare science uses measures such as
                  longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology,
                  and reproduction, although there is debate about which of
                  these best indicate animal welfare.

                  A number of animal welfare organisations are campaigning to
                  achieve a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare (UDAW) at

                  Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly
                  photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
                  Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms
                  including all living things that were not animals, and all
                  algae and fungi were treated as plants. However, all current
                  definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as
                  well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one
                  definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name
                  for "green plants"), a group that includes the flowering
                  plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their
                  allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae,
                  but excludes the red and brown algae.

                  of organisms or taxon, it usually refers to one of four
                  concepts. From least to most inclusive, these four groupings
